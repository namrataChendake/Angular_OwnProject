  <h4>The PNG beginning</h4>
  <p>
    The story of P N Gadgil Jewellers is no fairy tale but an epic scripted
    meticulously by six generations of the Gadgil clan. It all started way back
    in the 18th century, the group gets its name from the late Purshottam
    Narayan Gadgil, a doyen of the family and the chief architect who captured
    the hearts and imagination of the people with his ethics and his jewellery.
